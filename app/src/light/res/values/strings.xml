            widget, but the concept is the same.
         \n\nUsing the letter buttons (7) is very easy. Just spell app name that you\'re trying to find, locate appropriate letters and click on them!
         \nThat\'s it.
         \nIf one letter is not enough, add another one and another one, until the app is found.
         \nIf there are multiple results, just click on the app name field (1) and the next one will appear.
         \n\nNow, just have a look at below description with some hints:
