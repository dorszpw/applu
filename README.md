 This is the code repo for a unique widget open source app in Play Store [Uninstall & Run Widget](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.coddev.applu.light) letting you uninstall, launch & find your apps directly from your home screen! 

Features:

• finding, launching and uninstalling an app directly from the widget
• just find first letters from app name on the widget keyboard and run or uninstall it. It's really quick.
• handy list of last ran apps, always accesible from your home screen (no need to pull anything)
• you can use multiple widgets
• widgets with different, suited layouts

What makes this app different from similar apps?

Finding, launching and uninstalling any app directly from the widget. There are a few other "uninstall widgets" but you need to setup before usage which app you want to run or uninstall, which makes it not very usable.

Just add one of the widget layouts and enjoy this fast & lightweight app manager.

Ever imagined how great it would be to find & manage your apps without the hassle of entering other screens/apps? 
Then this is an app for you.

Do you install & remove a lot of apps? Now, you can uninstall them painlessly.

Are you an app developer, often installing and re-installing same apps? Just type in the name and enjoy ultra-fast launch & uninstall straight from the home screen.

NOTE:
AppLU cannot uninstall preinstalled apps in the system because it is limited by the Android security system.
